            <h4>Columbia Water Gardens is family owned and operated by the Petite family – Carl and Michelle, Zack, and Ian (our field technician).</h4>
            <p>Winner of Aquascape’s “Top Frog” and “Business of the Year” Award for 2014, ranked “#2 Aquascape Volume Retailer for 2014-2015 Worldwide” among Certified Aquascape Contractor Retailers, and awarded #2 Aquascape Top Frog for 2014-2015 Pond Season at 2015 Pondemonium.​Columbia Water Gardens is the local one stop place to shop for pond supplies, pond, waterfall, and lake construction, pond service, maintenance, and repair, for commercial and residential settings.We service and install ponds, waterfalls, and water features for Temecula, Beaumont, Palm Desert, Hemet California (CA).</p>
            <p>Our objective is not to sell you stuff, it is to solve the root cause of your problem. Whether is is a poorly built water feature, or an ecosystem that is out of balance, we really are equipped to help you with your pond, waterfall, fountain, or LED lightscaping.</p>
            <p>We are not your typical contractor. We have a highly trained staff that specializes in ecosystem water features. The best analogy here is that you may not want a foot doctor working on your brain, would you? Unfortunately, many homeowners resort to having their “lawn guy” work on their pond because they don’t know about us, or think we may be too expensive. You would be surprised! Even though we are highly trained, specialized, and award winning, we are competitively priced at a labor rate that is lower than most automobile mechanics.</p>
